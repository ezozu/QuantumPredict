# QuantumPredict: GPU-Accelerated Algorithmic Forex Binary Options Backtesting

A cutting-edge framework for backtesting Forex binary options trading strategies, leveraging stochastic volatility models, high-frequency tick data analysis, and GPU-accelerated simulations to achieve unparalleled performance and accuracy.

This repository houses QuantumPredict, a sophisticated tool designed to empower quantitative traders and financial researchers to rigorously evaluate the performance of their binary options trading strategies in a realistic market environment. Unlike traditional backtesting platforms that rely on simplistic models and low-resolution data, QuantumPredict utilizes advanced stochastic volatility models like the Heston model, calibrated to high-frequency tick data, to simulate price dynamics with exceptional fidelity. The computational intensity inherent in this approach is overcome through GPU acceleration, enabling rapid backtesting and parameter optimization. This allows users to explore a wide range of strategies and market conditions within a reasonable timeframe. QuantumPredict seeks to bridge the gap between theoretical models and real-world trading performance, providing valuable insights into the profitability and risk profile of different trading strategies.

The framework's core strength lies in its ability to handle the complexities of binary options pricing and execution. It incorporates realistic transaction costs, slippage models, and binary option contract specifications. Moreover, QuantumPredict facilitates the integration of custom trading logic, allowing users to implement and test their unique algorithms. The backtesting engine provides detailed performance metrics, including win rate, profit factor, maximum drawdown, and Sharpe ratio, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of strategy efficacy. By offering a robust and computationally efficient backtesting environment, QuantumPredict empowers users to make data-driven decisions and optimize their trading strategies for maximum profitability and risk management.

QuantumPredict is not just a backtesting engine; it is a complete ecosystem for developing and validating Forex binary options trading strategies. It provides a flexible and extensible architecture that can be adapted to various trading styles and market conditions. The modular design allows for easy integration of new data sources, models, and trading algorithms. Furthermore, the framework includes tools for data preprocessing, model calibration, and performance analysis. By providing a comprehensive suite of tools, QuantumPredict streamlines the entire backtesting process, from data acquisition to strategy optimization, enabling users to focus on developing innovative and profitable trading strategies.

## Key Features

*   **Stochastic Volatility Modeling:** Implements the Heston model for simulating realistic price dynamics, capturing the volatility clustering and mean reversion observed in real-world Forex markets. Heston model parameters are calibrated to high-frequency tick data using efficient maximum likelihood estimation techniques implemented in CUDA.
*   **GPU-Accelerated Simulations:** Leverages CUDA for parallel execution of simulations, significantly reducing backtesting time and enabling the exploration of a wider range of parameter combinations. The GPU implementation optimizes memory access patterns and arithmetic operations to maximize performance.
*   **High-Frequency Tick Data Analysis:** Supports ingestion and processing of high-frequency tick data, allowing for precise modeling of market microstructure effects and accurate backtesting of high-frequency trading strategies. The data processing pipeline includes data cleaning, aggregation, and feature engineering.
*   **Customizable Trading Logic:** Provides a flexible API for implementing custom trading algorithms, allowing users to define their own entry and exit rules based on technical indicators, price patterns, or other market signals. Trading logic is implemented as Typescript classes that inherit from a base TradingStrategy class.
*   **Comprehensive Performance Metrics:** Calculates a wide range of performance metrics, including win rate, profit factor, maximum drawdown, Sharpe ratio, and Sortino ratio, providing a comprehensive assessment of strategy performance. These metrics are calculated using efficient numerical algorithms to minimize computational overhead.
*   **Binary Option Contract Specifications:** Accurately models the payout structure of binary options contracts, including strike price, expiration time, and settlement rules. The framework supports both European and American style binary options.
*   **Realistic Market Simulation:** Incorporates realistic transaction costs, slippage models, and order book dynamics to simulate the execution of trades in a real-world market environment. Slippage is modeled as a function of trade size and market liquidity.

## Technology Stack

*   **Typescript:** The primary programming language, providing static typing and object-oriented features for building a robust and maintainable codebase. Typescript promotes code clarity and reduces the likelihood of runtime errors.
*   **Node.js:** The runtime environment for executing the Typescript code, providing a non-blocking, event-driven architecture for high performance. Node.js allows for efficient handling of asynchronous operations and network requests.
*   **CUDA:** NVIDIA's parallel computing platform and programming model for GPU acceleration, enabling massive parallel processing of simulations and calculations. CUDA allows for fine-grained control over GPU resources and optimizations.
*   **NumPy (via a Typescript binding):** Used for numerical computation and array manipulation, providing efficient data structures and algorithms for mathematical operations. NumPy bindings allow Typescript code to interact seamlessly with optimized NumPy libraries.
*   **Data Visualization Libraries (e.g., Chart.js):** Used for visualizing backtesting results and performance metrics, providing interactive charts and graphs for data exploration.
*   **Jest:** A testing framework for ensuring the quality and reliability of the code, providing a comprehensive suite of testing tools and utilities. Jest allows for unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing.

    *   CUDA Toolkit (version 11 or higher)
    *   NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support

2.  **Clone the repository:**
    git clone https://github.com/ezozu/QuantumPredict.git
    cd QuantumPredict

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    npm install

4.  **Build the project:**
    npm run build

5.  **Configure CUDA (Important):**
    Ensure that CUDA is properly installed and configured on your system. You may need to set environment variables such as `CUDA_HOME`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, and `PATH` to point to the CUDA installation directory. Consult the NVIDIA CUDA documentation for detailed instructions.

## Configuration

The following environment variables can be configured to customize the behavior of QuantumPredict:

*   `TICK_DATA_PATH`: The path to the directory containing the tick data files.
*   `HESTON_CALIBRATION_PERIOD`: The number of days to use for calibrating the Heston model parameters (default: 30).
*   `GPU_DEVICE_ID`: The ID of the GPU device to use for simulations (default: 0).
*   `BACKTEST_START_DATE`: The start date for the backtesting period (YYYY-MM-DD).
*   `BACKTEST_END_DATE`: The end date for the backtesting period (YYYY-MM-DD).

These environment variables can be set in a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. An example `.env` file is provided below:

TICK_DATA_PATH=/path/to/tick/data
HESTON_CALIBRATION_PERIOD=60
GPU_DEVICE_ID=1
BACKTEST_START_DATE=2023-01-01
BACKTEST_END_DATE=2023-03-31

## Usage

Example usage of the framework to run a basic backtest:

// Import the necessary modules
import { BacktestEngine } from './src/BacktestEngine';
import { SimpleMovingAverageStrategy } from './src/strategies/SimpleMovingAverageStrategy';
import { HestonModel } from './src/models/HestonModel';

// Create a new instance of the backtest engine
const backtestEngine = new BacktestEngine();

// Load the tick data
const tickData = backtestEngine.loadTickData('EURUSD', '2023-01-01', '2023-01-05');

// Calibrate the Heston model to the tick data
const hestonModel = new HestonModel();
hestonModel.calibrate(tickData);

// Create a new instance of the trading strategy
const strategy = new SimpleMovingAverageStrategy(20, 50); // 20 and 50 are the SMA periods

// Run the backtest
const results = backtestEngine.run(strategy, tickData, hestonModel);

// Print the results
console.log(results);

//The 'src/strategies/SimpleMovingAverageStrategy.ts' file should contain the SimpleMovingAverageStrategy class implementation.

Detailed API documentation will be provided in a separate document.
